Create a class named 'Member' having the following members:Data members1 - Name2 - Age3 - Phone number4 - Address5 - SalaryIt also has a method named 'printSalary' which prints the salary of the members.Two classes 'Employee' and 'Manager' inherits the 'Member' class. The 'Employee' and 'Manager' classes have data members 'specialization' and 'department' respectively. Now, assign name, age, phone number, address and salary to an employee and a manager by making an object of both of these classes and print the same.


2.Create a class named 'Rectangle' with two data members 'length' and 'breadth' and two methods to print the area and perimeter of the rectangle respectively. Its constructor having parameters for length and breadth is used to initialize length and breadth of the rectangle. Let class 'Square' inherit the 'Rectangle' class with its constructor having a parameter for its side (suppose s) calling the constructor of its parent class as 'super(s,s)'. Print the area and perimeter of a rectangle and a square.

3.Create a class named 'Shape' with a method to print "This is This is shape". Then create two other classes named 'Rectangle', 'Circle' inheriting the Shape class, both having a method to print "This is rectangular shape" and "This is circular shape" respectively. Create a subclass 'Square' of 'Rectangle' having a method to print "Square is a rectangle". Now call the method of 'Shape' and 'Rectangle' class by the object of 'Square' class.
